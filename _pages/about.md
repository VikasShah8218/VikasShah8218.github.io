Vikas Shah
======
Hi, I’m Vikas Shah, a passionate Software Development Engineer with strong expertise in full-stack development, backend engineering, and hardware–software integration. Over the past 2+ years, I’ve worked on building enterprise-grade solutions, integrating industrial hardware, and scaling real-time systems.

I specialize in Python (Django, FastAPI), React.js, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, Celery, and Docker, and have hands-on experience deploying applications on AWS and Google Cloud. My journey has also involved working with hardware devices like HID Aero/Vertx access controllers, Moxa/Adam modules, IP cameras, MiFare/iClass card readers, and UBio-X biometric systems — bridging the gap between physical devices and enterprise applications.

Some of my key projects include:

 - Visitor Management Systems (MOD-VMS, DS-VMS) with advanced features like facial recognition, blacklist detection, and 99%+ visitor tracking accuracy.

 - ANPR & Video Analytics pipelines capable of processing 1000+ camera streams and analyzing 50K+ vehicle frames daily with real-time GIS mapping and alerts.

 - ERP, Ticketing, and Healthcare Platforms designed with modular microservices, fault tolerance, and secure data handling.

Beyond development, I take pride in system architecture, DevOps automation, and AI/ML integration, ensuring that applications are not only functional but also scalable, reliable, and future-ready.

I strongly believe in ownership, problem-solving, and continuous learning. My focus is on delivering impactful solutions that combine innovation, performance, and usability. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with AI tools, and sharing knowledge through projects.
