# Portfolio Site (Tailwind + Multi‑page)

**Pages**
- `index.html` — Home
- `experience.html` — Roles & impact
- `education.html` — Education & certs
- `resume.html` — PDF embed (drop your file at `assets/resume.pdf`)
- `contact.html` — Static contact form (hook to your backend)

**How to use**
1. Replace text like **Your Name**, links, and contact info.
2. Put your resume PDF at `assets/resume.pdf` so the embed works.
3. Open `index.html` locally, or deploy the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Nginx).

**Notes**
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN (no build step).
- The design is responsive, with a glass/gradient look.
- To add more sections, duplicate the card patterns in each page.
